    <h2>KS20: Important COVID-19 Update</h2>

      <p>Dear Kombucha Summit community: first off, we hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy.</p>
      <p>Secondly, for all of us entrepreneurs, these times are extremely challenging, and we're facing never-seen-before obstacles. We wish each and every one of you the best of luck, and hope things return to normality for you all as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Where we stand with Kombucha Summit 2020: based on current information, we will run the conference as planned. We confirmed this with the venue this morning, and all we can do is hope that, by September, things are back to normality.
      Please bear in mind that all tickets can be refunded up to 30 days before the Summit, which means that you can purchase your tickets today without having to worry that you will lose your money later. There are currently 11 tickets left at the Tier 1 price of 129â‚¬, available until March 31.</p>
      <p>For any questions or concerns, please feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:info@kombuchasummit.com">info@kombuchasummit.com</a>.</p>
      <p>We wish everyone a lot of strength, and we hope to see everyone in happy spirits this September!<p>
      Have a great evening,<br>
      Your Kombucha Summit Team
