    We are very excited to have <a href="https://rarecombinations.com/" target="_blank">Rare Combinations</a> from the US joining us next month.

    <h3 class="sub-headline">What does Rare Combinations do and what is your role in the company?</h3>

    <p>Rare Combinations provides affordable, simple, and fast in-house alcohol testing devices. 
      I am the man of all hats in this company; I invented, designed, and build the alcohol content 
      detectors, do customer service, and sales.

    <p>Since I am a small company I like to think that I 
      am able to provide personalized service to all of my customers! Previously I have hand-delivered 
      devices to purchasers who are local to me and have made time to visit brewers in other states as well! 
      Since beginning sales about a year ago, I have sold over 50 devices including one to GTâ€™s Kombucha, 
      the first and largest producer in the United States.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-headline">Since when have you been following the Kombucha market and why?</h3>


    <p>Three summers ago, I was brewing and selling kombucha at my local farmerâ€™s market. When business was going well and I wanted to move the product into stores, I ran into this alcohol content issue that I later found many others have faced. I spent a year developing an easy and affordable device that can find alcohol content of kombucha in-house!</p>

    <h3 class="sub-headline">What role does your business want to play in the Kombucha market with its products?</h3>
    <p>
    Rare Combinations LLC makes connections with kombucha brewers to help reduce alcohol content to legal levels. With the alcohol detector device, it is much easier to determine when this goal has been reached!
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-headline">What are your expectations in exhibiting at the Kombucha Summit?</h3>
    <p>
    Through the Virtual Kombucha Summit, I hope to make connections with brewers, particularly brewers outside of the United States.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-headline">Whatâ€™s the best way for Kombucha brewers to get in touch with you?</h3>
