      <u>Kara</u>: Over the years, we've expanded our portfolio to include other markets such as kombucha. I oversee our operations on the laboratory portion of the business and also work heavily in new poduct development.
    </p> 

    <h3 class="sub-headline">Since when have you been following the Kombucha market and why?</h3>

    <p>
      <u>Joanne</u>: Entering the kombucha market was a natural fit for our company due to our expertise and understanding of beverage fermentation. As Kombucha became more popular in the US market, we started to receive inquiries from producers to assist them with both regulatory and QC questions. So we started offering specific Kombucha analysis packages and then started to produce a commercial SCOBY culture.
      <br><u>Kara</u>: When I started at White Labs in 2009, a grocery store chain in the states had to recall much of the kombucha on the shelves due to high alcohol percentages. We immediately became a resource for kombucha makers, helping them troubleshoot their fermentation issues so they could comply with regulations and create better products. </p>

    <h3 class="sub-headline">What role does your business want to play in the Kombucha market with its products?</h3>
    <p>
      Our analytical lab provides an array of analysis for your SCOBY and kombucha. We can provide microbiological analysis, acid percentages, alcohol content, sugars and more. Several years ago, we started offering a lab certified SCOBY culture.   
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-headline">What are your expectations in exhibiting at the Kombucha Summit?</h3>
    <p>
      <u>Joanne</u>: As the Kombucha market continues to grow globally, we see more inquiries for our SCOBY culture and analytical services outside the US. By participating in this conference, we will learn more about the needs of the market, and how we can assist Kombucha brewers in producing the highest quality product possible. 
      <br><u>Kara</u>: I hope to have a better understanding of what the kombucha culture looks like worldwide. I only see it currently from the perspective in the US.
