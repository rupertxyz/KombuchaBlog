    <h3 class="sub-headline">Describe your product in one sentence and tell us about your brand.</h3>
    <p>We make Surf Kombucha, a light, fresh and bubbly Kombucha form Norway. We have four flavours: raspberry, mango, lime and tropical ginger. We also have a new one coming out in September, and one Christmas edition that weÂ´re excited to brew again! When we choose tea, flavours and are brewing, we are going for the light Kombucha taste in the hope that most people will like it. WeÂ´re also thriving for the most possible organic ingredients.</p>

      Maren grew up on a farm in Norway. When studying nutrition, she learned about the importance about a healthy gut and digestion, and also about fermented foods, drinks and got to taste kombucha for the first time.
      Luca grew up in Portugal, with a Norwegian mom and French dad, and worked as a sponsored surfer since he was 15. When travelling together to California for the first time in 2015, we descovered how popular Kombucha was there and fell in love with the taste. We wanted more of this in Norway (!!) and thatÂ´s how it all started. Later we travelled to NYC and Hawaii to learn more about how to brew for a big production since there was no one in Norway we could go visit and learn from.

    <h3 class="sub-headline">Whatâ€˜s your current stage?</h3>
    <p>We were one of the first ones starting a Kombucha brewery in Norway in 2016 and are now selling in over 200 shops, cafÃ©s, restaurants and hotels in the whole country. We have our own brewery her in the contryside in Norway. Our dream is to bring Surf Kombucha to Portugal were Luca grew up, and maybe some other countries in Europe. We both work 100% with Surf Kombucha, but right now our time is a bit limitied since we also home with and taking care of our 9 months old baby boy, Noah. Busy days, but weÂ´re loving being our own bosses and to have a flexible work schedule.</p>

    <h3 class="sub-headline">What excites you most about Kombucha and its future?</h3>
    <p>
    When we started three years ago almost no one knew what Kombucha was. Now we can go in a normal grocery store and yet ItÂ´s still a quite unknown product. It's definitely spreading out though. Kombucha is a great alternative to alcohol and sugary drinks. People want that and the market needs more alternatives. ThatÂ´s exciting to be a part of. WeÂ´re also hoping to be part of a research project this winter to get more knowledge about what out kombucha and culture actually contains in terms of bacteria, yeast etc.</p>

    <h3 class="sub-headline">What are your expectations in attending the Kombucha Summit?</h3>
    <p>
    WeÂ´ve been wanting to go to the summit in California, but it never fit the sceduale and itÂ´s so far away. So awesome, this is happening in Europe! WeÂ´re really excited to meet other Kombucha brewers, get some new contacts, see other breweries, and hopefully get some answers, especially on whats going on in the world of research.
