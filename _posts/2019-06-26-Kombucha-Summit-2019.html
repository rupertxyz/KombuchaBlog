<p>With this first post, we are super stoked to launch the Kombucha Summit Blog.</p>

<p>This is a place where you will be able to find stories,
news and announcements on both the <a href="http://kombuchasummit.com">Kombucha Summit</a> and the Kombucha market in general.</p>

<p>Before going a little deeper into our mission and who we are, we would like to
express a huge thank you to all the 30 people who purchased Early Bird tickets.
The response since our ticket launch ten days ago was simply amazing and we sold
out all 30 tickets within the first 6 days! This is a clear sign that the Kombucha
community was in need of such a platform and event, which is a great validation of our efforts so far.</p>

<p>The idea of Kombucha Summit was born in March of 2019, when Fabio and Rupert from
<a href="http://drinkroy.com" target="_blank">ROY Kombucha</a> met Denis Kelleher from <a href="http://goodculturekombucha.com" target="_blank">Good Culture Kombucha</a> for the first time in Barcelona.</p>

<p>Coming from an event and community building background, Fabio and Rupert were once again
amazed by what was going on in Europe's Kombucha market when hearing about Denis' stories
and experiences. Being in the midst of setting up their own Kombucha brewery, which will open this summer in Berlin, Fabio and Rupert
knew exactly what the challenges for commercial producers are.</p>

<p>Matching these experiences with Denis' network & expertise
and network seemed like the logical next move and that's when the idea for Kombucha Summit was born!</p>

<p>To see our idea come to life in the past few months and especially receive such a positive
response since our ticket launch, is simply amazing.</p>

<p>To put it in once sentence, we launched the Kombucha Summit to provide a knowledge exchange platform for commercial Kombucha producers from around the world. Beyond that, our goal is to bring everyone involved in the fast-growing Kombucha industry, meaning producers, stakeholders and industry partners, into one place and foster exchange and networking. The core of the event will be talks and panel discussions addressing various topics such as market outlook, production, founder stories as well as marketing and health. On top of that we will have Europe's largest Kombucha bar serving all the Kombuchas that were sent to us by our attendees. On the second day a handful Berlin-based Kombucha breweries will open their dors for everyone to have get a behind-the-scenes look.</p>

<p>As for our speakers, we will be announcing them in the following weeks through this blog and our social media channels, so make sure to follow us and stay tuned. We hope to meet as many of you as possible in Berlin this October and already can't wait for the Kombucha Summit to kick-off!</p>
