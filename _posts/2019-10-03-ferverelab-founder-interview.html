    <h3 class="sub-headline">Describe your product in one sentence and tell us about your brand.</h3>
    <p>
      Fervere Kombucha was born from the wish to offer an alternative to people like us that are bored to find
      always the same drinks around. We wanted to create a strong alternative to alcoholic drinks, but
      also to common bad quality soft drinks, with massive quantity of added sugars, chemicals and
      other ingredients we don‚Äôt like. That is how we started making Kombucha and this is why we only
      use top quality ingredients ‚Äì for instance, we import our black tea from a tiny farm in Nepal. Our
      clients are mostly people interested in an healthy way of life, in quality food, home made
      preparation and professionals.

    <h3 class="sub-headline">What‚Äòs your story and how did you get started?</h3>

    <p>
      We ‚Äì Bea, Claudia, Andrea and Daniele ‚Äì discovered Kombucha as a product in 2016 when a client
      of Andrea and Bea ‚Äì they own a tea shop in Bari, south of Italy ‚Äì told them about it. In a while they
      ‚Äúcontaminated‚Äù me (Daniele) and Claudia and we started making Kombucha at home.
      We started Fervere in March 2018 when we realized that it could be fun. At the beginning it was
      really hard to find the best recipes, to understand how to be in compliance with all the food and
      safety legislation, but also with the Italian bureaucracy ‚Äì known around the world as contorted
      and complex. It took time, but in 2019 we had finally four steady recipes, a lab and some clear
      ideas on how to manage this new adventure.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-headline">What‚Äòs your current stage?</h3>
    <p>
      Today - after less than one year - we sell our Kombucha nationally, as well as a starter kit to make
      Kombucha at home. We have happy customers from north to south that support us and help
      us improving our project.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-headline">What excites you most about Kombucha and its future?</h3>
    <p>
      It is common among us wondering about Kombucha in Europe and especially in Italy. We realized
      how much interest there is in the US or Australia, and how it is growing in Europe ‚Äì for instance the
      Summit is a clear proof of this positive trend. We are also seeing ourselves how the interest and
      knowledge around Kombucha is growing in Italy. It make us happy because we strongly believe in
      the ‚Äúpower‚Äù of Kombucha and all the fermented foods and we hope they will spread.
      We also think that it is time to have a good and healthy alternative to soda drinks.

    <h3 class="sub-headline">What are your expectations in attending the Kombucha Summit?</h3>
    <p>
      We are really happy to be part of the Summit this year. It will be a great
      opportunity for us to compare and discuss with other brewers and enthusiasts, but also a chance
      to taste hundreds of Kombuchas. We love it!
