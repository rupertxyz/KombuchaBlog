    <h3 class="sub-headline">Describe your product in one sentence and tell us about your brand.</h3>
    <p>We are Kombru, we make tasty drinks that are refreshingly non-evil. Our Kombucha is
    handcrafted in Hamburg using the traditional methods, and only ingredients that are
    certified organic. Currently, Kombru comes in two flavours, which are Lemon, Ginger
    & Joyful Bacteria and Fig, Lime & Friendly Bacteria. We also have two more flavours in
    the pipe-line. Kombru is made up of Fernando Silvestrin, Mat Owen and lots of happy
    bacteria.

    <p>
    It all started with Fernando breaking his arm. After surgery, he contracted a superbug
    from the hospital, which left him feeling seriously out-of-whack. Fernando was on
    the lookout for ways to bring his body back into balance and discovered kombucha.
    Then he told me (Mat) about it, but I wasnâ€™t convinced. Then he mentioned it again.
    And again. And possibly another time. Then I tried it and quickly saw why he was so
    excited by his discovery. So, we bought some scobies and started brewing from home.
    Once we had a consistent base brew, we began to experiment with the flavour. We use
    cold-pressed bio fruit, as we want a big, natural flavour which we also make ourselves.
    Once we had some flavours pinned down, we took our bru to Eat n Style in Hamburg,
    which is a huge food festival. We got the public to try them and asked them to help us
    decide on which two flavours to launch with.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-headline">Whatâ€˜s your current stage?</h3>
    <p>We are currently selling to several Edeka supermarkets throughout Hamburg and a
    few coffee shops. We also sponsor art events such as the Millerntor Gallery and the XH
    Collective with refreshing bru. We think that itâ€™s important to immerse yourself in all
    types of good culture. We no longer brew from home and have converted a shop, that
    was a fake-eyelash salon, into the Kombru HQ boochery â€“ where we make our all
    natural, non-evil bru.

    <h3 class="sub-headline">What excites you most about Kombucha and its future?</h3>
    <p>
    The food we eat directly determines how healthy our gut is, and that has a direct
    relationship to our emotions and mood. Our modern, highly processed diet can have a
    detrimental effect on our gut microbiome and wellbeing. We want to make it super
    easy for people to restore their bodyâ€™s natural balance of friendly gut bacteria and as a
    result live healthier and happier lives. So, our mission is to provide an alternative to
    sugary, synthetic, over-processed soda. Something that still tastes great, but is way
    more beneficial to your body.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-headline">What are your expectations in attending the Kombucha Summit?</h3>
    <p>
    Weâ€™re keen to meet fellow brewers from around Europe and swap tips with them.
    Weâ€™re also eager to learn more about how to scale things up and find out about the
    latest developments in production. Weâ€™re basically looking forward to having fun with
    like-minded people and combining that with our passion for kombucha. Auf dein
    wohl!
