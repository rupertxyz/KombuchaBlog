    <p>Hello <i>Kombucha nation</i>! Today, we would like to introduce another partner of ours to you.
    We are very excited to have the label producer <a href="https://www.etikett.de" target="_blank">etikett.de</a> from Germany with us for the Summit in October.
    We had a chance to ask them a few questions about their business and their outlook on the Kombucha market in general.

    <h3 class="sub-headline">What does etikett.de do and what is your role in the company?</h3>
    <p>As an expert for self-adhesive and wet-glue labels, etikett.de is the ideal printing partner for your Kombucha labels.
    As the online market leader for custom labels, we rely on efficient technology, state-of-the-art machinery, lean workflows and a dynamic team. This guarantees you the best print quality,
    adherence to delivery dates, competent service and maximum satisfaction.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-headline">Since when have you been following the Kombucha market and why?</h3>
    <p>Particularly in the USA, the Kombucha tea drink is very much in vogue and can now be found on almost
    every beverage shelf. For the European market, too, it is now time to pick up on the trend and establish
    the drink in the local retail trade. Kombucha is an interesting product as a natural and refreshing alternative
    to often artificially tasting and excessively sweetened soft drinks. Kombucha compliments another trend in the food industry:
    customers who are particularly interested in a healthy diet and lifestyle rely on the fermented tea drink. As a product label manufacturer, we would like to support and promote the
    growth of Kombucha on the German market with unique and high-quality labels.
