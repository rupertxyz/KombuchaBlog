    <h2>KS20 is Happening: Important Update</h2>
      <p>Dear fellow Kombucha brewers and Kombucha Summit community,</p>
      <p>Strange weeks lie behind us. The current pandemic has changed our lives and forced us all to be creative and come up with new ways of doing things. We hope you’re healthy and your business hasn’t suffered too much due to this situation.</p>
      <p>Looking at KS20, everything was up in the air for the past weeks and we didn't really know what will happen and how things will look like in September. We have been following government updates closely and were in constant touch with the venue and we now wanted to let you know that at this point in time, we believe <b>that Kombucha Summit can happen as planned in Berlin this September!</b></p>
      <p>The authorities here in Germany are increasingly loosening restrictions and we’re confident that events with less than 1000 participants will be possible again. That being said, we are working hard on putting the final agenda together in the coming weeks and will, of course, let you know as soon as we have further news!</p>
      <p>As for tickets: please keep in mind that since our ticket release on March 1, <b>we always offer a 100% ticket refund up until 30 days of the event.</b> In other words, there is no risk for you to buy tickets today, as you can cancel them any time until the middle of August.<p>
      <p>Due to the whole uncertainty in the past weeks, we have decided to <b>extend our Tier 3 price of 189€ until June 10.</b> To buy your ticket, please <a href="https://www.eventbrite.de/e/kombucha-summit-2020-tickets-97340236267?aff=odeimcmailchimp&mc_cid=b2ffb808f9&mc_eid=[UNIQID]">follow this link.</a></p>
      <p>For any questions or concerns, please feel free to email us at <a href="maillto:info@kombuchasummit.com">info@kombuchasummit.com</a>. We wish everyone all the best, and we hope to see you in September!</p>
      <p>Have a great rest of the week,<br>
      Your Kombucha Summit Team</p>
