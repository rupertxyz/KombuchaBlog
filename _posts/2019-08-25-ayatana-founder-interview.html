    <h3 class="sub-headline">Describe your product in one sentence and tell us about your brand.</h3>
    <p>AYATANA Kombucha is handcrafted real food and fermented goodness with cherry-picked ingredients
    that will make you feel #cleangutthappybutt. We flavor our Kombucha only with the best
    ingredients we can find, locally or regionally sourced. Our AYATANA hops Kombucha is
    made with aromatic Slovenian hops of the highest quality, which gives the drink a
    fantastic sweet flavor and aftertaste. AYATANA rosehip is a gentler version of our Kombucha.

    <p>
      Our story started in 2018 when the development of the Kombucha started. By the end of the year, we had the production line set up. We introduced AYATANA Kombucha on the market at the beginning of the summer of 2019. Our goal is to introduce the ancient know-how of making Kombucha, along with all the benefits it holds to a broader audience.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-headline">Whatâ€˜s your current stage?</h3>
    <p>We are a relatively new brand of Kombucha. At the moment we sell in Slovenia, with a plan to go over the borders. We produce Kombucha in-house and have the full capacity of 28.000 liters a month.</p>

    <h3 class="sub-headline">What excites you most about Kombucha and its future?</h3>
    <p>We are going back to basics. Kombucha is an ancient product of our ancestors, and we truly believe in bringing their knowledge back. Kombucha is the future and our mission is to educate people about fermented foods, take them away from unhealthy drinks, and show Kombuchas' benefits on their health and well-being.</p>
