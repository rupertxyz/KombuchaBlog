<p>JARR is a Kombucha brewery based in Hackney Wick, East London founded by old friends Adam, Jess, Tom, Neil and Dom.
After visiting Adam at his home in Los Angeles in 2015 and realising that they all shared a passion for Kombucha, the
group of friends set out to create a drink that challenged the norm by offering an alternative to artificially produced,
sugary soft drinks. In Autumn of 2015 they opened the first Kombucha taproom in Europe offering their 3 flavours: Original,
Ginger and Passion Fruit on draft and in cocktails. In April of 2016 they launched their first bottled range into Harrods
and have been honing their technique and spreading the word about Kombucha every since.</p>

<p>We already can't wait for Adam's talk and interview to learn more about JARR's success story!</p>
