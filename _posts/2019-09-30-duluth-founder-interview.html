    <p>
      I started brewing kombucha for myself at home when I found myself consistently sick. I was working 100-hour weeks and they were taking their toll. I had a friend suggest kombucha. I started buying it from the local co-op. At the time, there was only one option and it was very expensive, but it was making me feel better! I thought "if someone else made this, then I can make it". I started doing my research and began brewing at home. My local community had a very positive response and the company naturally evolved from there.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-headline">Whatâ€˜s your current stage?</h3>
    <p>
      Currently I have a shared commercial kitchen that I operate out of. I'm selling locally and have 11 wholesale accounts that offer my product on tap. I'm still growing and expanding. I work in the business full-time and am loving it.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-headline">What excites you most about Kombucha and its future?</h3>
    <p>
      I believe Kombucha is a great alternative to coffee or sugary sodas. Our gut health is so important and kombucha is a great way to introduce fermented foods/beverages into our diet.

    <h3 class="sub-headline">What are your expectations in attending the Kombucha Summit?</h3>
    <p>
      I have no expectations, I am just looking forward to whatever this opportunity may bring. I've been following so many fellow brewers on social media and am excited to finally meet them. I believe that we all do better when we all do better and believe this summit will be a great opportunity for all of us to learn from and with each other.
