<p>With this first post, we are super stoked to launch the Kombucha Summit Blog.</p>

<p>This is a place where you will be able to find stories,
news and announcements around both the Kombucha Summit and the Kombucha market in general.</p>

<p>Before going a little deeper into our mission and who we are, we would like to
express a huge thank you to all the 30 people who purchased Early Bird tickets.
The response since our ticket launch ten days ago was simply amazing and we sold
out all 30 tickets within the first 6 days! This is a clear sign that the Kombucha
community was in need of such a platform and event, which is a great validation of our efforts so far.</p>

<p>The idea of Kombucha Summit was born in March of 2019, when Fabio and Rupert from
<a href="http://drinkroy.com" target="_blank">ROY Kombucha</a> met Denis Kelleher from <a href="http://goodculturekombucha.com" target="_blank">Good Culture Kombucha</a> for the first time in Barcelona.
Coming from an event and community building background, Fabio and Rupert were once again
amazed by what was going on in Europe's Kombucha market when hearing about Denis' stories
and experiences. Being in the midst of setting up their own Kombucha brewery, Fabio and Rupert
knew exactly what the challenges for commercial producers are. Matching this with Denis' expertise
and network seemed like a logical thing and that's when the idea for Kombucha Summit was born!</p>

<p>To see our idea come to life in the past few months and especially receive such a positive
response since our ticket launch, is simply amazing.</p>
