  <p style="margin-top: 50px">Dear fellow brewers and participants of the first annual Kombucha Summit,
<br><br>Less than one month to go until Kombucha Summit kicks off and we have a few important updates to share
with you:</p>

  alt="Less than 50 tickets left"><br>
</div>
<p>First off, we are incredible happy to be able to say that our event is <b>close to being sold out</b>!
We have over 150 amazing attendees joining from over 25 countries and our maximum capacity for the event
is 200. That being said, if you haven't purchased your tickets yet, we highly recommend you to
do so quickly :-)</p>

<p>Secondly, we are excited to extend our Day 2 program <b>with additional speeches and workshops</b>. All of this happening at the beautiful Betahaus again, where all of Day 1 takes place as well. The brewery tours will then kick off after lunch time and go on throughout the afternoon.
When thinking of how we could provide more value and content to all of you, we felt it was important to give you guys the chance to share your stories and experiences. This is why Day 2 is all about stories, insights and learnings from fellow Kombucha brewers. For more information, <a href="kombuchasummit.com/#schedule">check out our program.</a></p>
