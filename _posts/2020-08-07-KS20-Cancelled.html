    <h2>KS20 is Cancelled: Important Update</h2>
    <p>Dear Kombucha Summit Community,</p>
    <p>We hope you’re doing well and are staying safe during these strange and challenging times.</p>
    <p>We have some bad news and some good news to share with you regarding this year’s Kombucha Summit:
      While we were optimistic for quite a while that the conference can still happen in person mid-September,
      we had to change our minds in the last days for three connected reasons:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>The pandemic itself: Even though it’s late summer, the pandemic is ongoing and many
    countries are still suffering from a huge number of infections. We had hoped that the
    situation would have gotten a lot better by this point. Unfortunately, in many countries,
    the contrary is the case.</li>
    <li>Because of point one, people are justifiably scared to travel and many
    community members have reached out and told us that they won’t make it this year.</li>
    <li>After intensive consultation with the venue, it is clear that the regulations we would
    have to follow for a physical event are extremely restrictive at this point in time.
    We would only be able to accommodate about 75 attendees, which is about a quarter of
    the planned number of participants. Unfortunately,
    this scenario wouldn’t make the event financially sustainable.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Therefore, Kombucha Summit is not happening as a physical event in Berlin on
    September 19-20. This decision was extremely hard to make, as we would have loved to
    welcome everybody once again for the second edition of Kombucha Summit in person this year.
    Nonetheless, looking at the above points, this is the most reasonable choice and we trust
    that you will understand it.</p>
    <p>We feel sorry for all of you who already booked flights, trains, hotels, etc.
    and might not be able to get a refund. All purchased tickets for Kombucha Summit will,
    of course, be refunded. Simply log in to your Eventbrite account and request a refund.
    Here's a how-to-guide: <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/support/articles/en_US/How_To/can-i-get-a-refund?lg=en_US&aff=odeimcmailchimp&mc_cid=751bd81d1c&mc_eid=[UNIQID]">LINK</a></p>
    <p>While the Summit cannot happen as a physical event, we’re working hard to create a
    Kombucha Summit “Virtual Edition”. We plan to run an online conference to which we
    invite all of you to join for expert and community talks, AMAs, engaging workshops
    and peer-to-peer knowledge sharing. More details about it will follow in the next weeks.</p>
    <p>Once again, we are extremely saddened to have had to share this news with you.
    For any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate con contact us at <a href="mailto:info@kombuchasummit.com">info@kombuchasummit.com</a>.</p>
    <p>All the very best,<br>
    Your Kombucha Summit Team</p>
