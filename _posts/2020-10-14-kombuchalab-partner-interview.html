    <h3 class="sub-headline">Since when have you been following the Kombucha market and why?</h3>


    <p>We officially launched CDR KombuchaLab in April 2020. After the big success in the beverage sector with CDR WineLab¬Æ, CDR BeerLab¬Æ and CDR CiderLab, we are presenting now the new system for analysis on Kombucha.<br><br>
      The idea to develop a specific analysis system for Kombucha came from the increase of the production of this beverage and the continuous requests that we received in recent times.</p>
