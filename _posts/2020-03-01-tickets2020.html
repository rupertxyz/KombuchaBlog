  <p>This year, we are introducing 5 different tiers of tickets, each running for a period of one month or until 50 tickets are sold. From July onwards, our standard ticket price will apply.</p>

  <p>Tickets start at 129€ (Tier 1) and will increase by 30€ with each tier (Tier 2 starting April 1 for example). That being said, if you are already certain that you will join us for KS20, be sure to grab your tickets right away. :)</p>

  <p>On our website, you can already find 9 amazing industry partners, which will be exhibiting during this year's Summit. Some of them will also host hands-on workshops, which will be announced in the coming weeks. Also, we will be announcing a preliminary conference schedule and confirmed speakers soon, so please check our website for updates or make sure to read our upcoming newsletters.</p>

  <p>If you want to have your own Kombucha included at our beloved and highly visited Kombucha Bar, then make sure to tick "yes" during ticket checkout. Last year we had over 50 Kombucha brands available for tasting and we hope to have many more this year. :)</p>

  <p>For any questions, please feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:info@kombuchasummit.com">info@kombuchasummit.com</a>. We cannot wait to welcome you all here in Berlin this September!</p>

  <p>We are looking forward to welcoming all of you in Berlin!!<br><i>The Kombucha Summit Team</i></p>
