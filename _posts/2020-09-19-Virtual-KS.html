    <p>We hope you are doing well and keeping safe wherever you are! We are very excited to finally announce Virtual Kombucha Summit 2020! While we, unfortunately, had to cancel our in-person event, we truly believe that this Virtual Summit will provide a ton of value to all of you.</p>

On top, the platform will allow for structured debates around various topics (best equipment/processes, business tips & tricks, getting into retail, etc.).</p>
    <p>We are very happy to already have 8 confirmed amazing speakers, which you can <a href="https://kombuchasummit.com/#speakers">find here</a>. Early Bird tickets are now live and this is the overall ticket structure:</p>
