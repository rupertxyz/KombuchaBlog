    <p>Hello <i>Kombucha nation</i>! Today, we would like to start introducing our partners to you.
    We are very excited to have the equipment producer <a href="https://www.polsinelli.it/en" target="_blank">Polsinelli Enologia</a> from Italy with us for the Summit in October.
    Coming from the beer, wine and olive oil industry and with decades of experience, their products are suitable for small as well as mid-sized productions and many Kombucha brewers use their products already today. We are very thankful that Polsinelli supports Kombucha Summit's mission and the Kombucha industry in general!

    <h3 class="sub-headline">What does Polsinelli do and what is your role in the company?</h3>
    <p>Polsinelli was founded in 1958 and produces equipment for wine, beer and olive oil production as well as equipment for the beverage industry in general.
    Over the past decades, we have kept on expanding our product range and offering to adapt to new market needs. We specialize in equipment for small to mid-sized productions.
    In second generation, Daniele Polsinelli is the owner and CEO of the company.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-headline">Since when have you been following the Kombucha market and why?</h3>
    <p>We have been following the Kombucha market for 3 years now. This for the main reason because Kombucha is an organic product that seems to be very attractive in terms of quality and future development of the market. Moreover, the product and the industry in general seems to be in line with our vision.

    <h3 class="sub-headline">What role does your business want to play in the Kombucha market with its products?</h3>
    <p>
    Since we focus on small and mid-sized productions, we want to support upcoming and growing Kombucha businesses around the globe. All of our products are of highest quality, longlasting and produced in our inhouse manufactory.
    We use stainless steel which we believe to be the best material to produce and store large amounts of Kombucha.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-headline">What are your expectations in exhibiting at the Kombucha Summit?</h3>
    <p>
    We would like to get more in touch with Kombucha brewers as well as the industry. Hopefully, we can have deep conversations around Kombucha production, share knowledge and form longlasting relationships.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-headline">Whatâ€™s the best way for Kombucha brewers to get in touch with you?</h3>
    <p>They can visit our website or send an email to <a href="mailto:elisa@polsinelli.it">elisa@polsinelli.it</a> or <a href="mailto:export@polsinelli.it">export@polsinelli.it</a>.
