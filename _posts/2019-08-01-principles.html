  <p style="margin-top: 50px">Dear fellow brewers and participants of the first annual Kombucha Summit,<br><br>
  Firstly, thank you for joining us, we are looking forward to welcoming all of you in October!
  Kombucha Summit is a platform for both aspiring and established Kombucha entrepreneurs globally.
  Over the coming years, we aim to create a platform that helps you grow and succeed, which of course
  will strengthen the entire industry, and grow awareness of Kombucha more generally.
  It’s exciting that there are so many of you coming together for this.
  <br><br>We are aware that many are joining the Summit in order to achieve similar goals, so with this in mind, we ask all of you to carefully read and adhere to the following principles and the Kombucha Summit Code of Conduct.
  </p>
  <h2>Principles</h2>
  <h5 style="margin-top: 30px">1. Protection of ideas & work</h5>
  <p>The Kombucha space is getting busier by the day, and, of course, within this space, we are all influencing each other. While we recognise that inspiration is inevitable, we stand behind the protection of originality. At Kombucha Summit, we strive to create a safe space in which the sharing of knowledge is encouraged, and where each of you agrees to never copy or steal ideas.</p>

  <h5>2. Culture of sharing & participation</h5>
  <p>In joining us at Kombucha Summit, you are joining a community. We believe strong communities manage to keep a delicate balance between members giving and receiving. We encourage you to be open and share successes, failures and tips, and in return, you will be rewarded with the same. We hope to facilitate a shared experience that is beneficial for everyone involved.</p>

  <h5>3. Let’s have fun</h5>
  <p>We’re sure you’ll agree: the Kombucha industry is the most exciting industry to be in! Over the coming years, we each have the chance to influence millions of people’s lives with what we’re doing. This is something that we should take very seriously, but that doesn’t mean we can’t enjoy the journey. With Kombucha Summit, we hope to build an environment that is easy and accessible, even when discussing serious topics.</p>

  <h5>4. Be good to each other</h5>
  <p>We have a hard line when it comes to harassment, both at the event and within the community. Good old golden rule: Please treat others as you wish to be treated.</p>

  <h2>Code of Conduct and anti-harassment policy</h2>
  <p>We’re striving to keep Kombucha Summit harassment-free. In order to do so, we require each of you, as well as our partners, exhibitors, speakers, volunteers and staff, to agree to the following Code of Conduct. We will not tolerate breaches of this policy.</p>

  <h5>1. Be open. Be inclusive.</h5>
  <p>Kombucha Summit has been designed to be an enriching experience for everyone, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age or religion. Treat everyone with respect, and in return, everyone will treat you with respect. We all deserve to participate and each of us has the right to enjoy our experience without fear of harassment, discrimination, or condescension, whether blatant or via micro-aggressions. Jokes shouldn’t demean others. Consider what you are saying and how it would feel if it were said to or about you.</p>

  <h5>2. Speak up.</h5>
  <p>If you feel you’ve been disrespected or discriminated against, or see someone else being disrespected or discriminated against, politely make the offending person aware of their behaviour. If the person continues acting in this way, alert Kombucha Summit staff immediately. Organisers will then take the action they deem most appropriate and could include official warnings or expulsion.</p>

  <p>Note that harassment includes, but is not limited to: verbal language that reinforces social structures of domination related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or other protected category; sexual imagery in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; offensive verbal language; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.</p>

  <p>The event staff can be identified by special attire. Please note, while we take all concerns raised seriously, we will use our discretion to determine when and how to follow up on reported incidents and may decline to take any further action and/or may direct the involved parties to other resources for resolution.</p>

  <p>Please send us feedback and make suggestions if you think these principles should be added or amended!</p>

  <p>Thank you very much,<br>
  The Kombucha Summit Team
