    <h3 class="sub-headline">Describe your product in one sentence and tell us about your brand.</h3>
    <p>Here comes The Good Guys! :) We are a group of friends
    and one of the fastest growing kombucha brewery in Scandinavia.
    Our kombucha is handcrafted using cold-pressed juices from organic
    produce, and high quality loose leaf tea. Currently we have four bottle flavours:
    Sencha Green Tea, Fresh Ginger, Sunshine Turmeric, and Strawberry & Basil.
    In addition we have many other great flavours in tap.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-headline">Whatâ€˜s your story and how did you get started?</h3>
    <p>
    All started for the love of great quality tea and all the benefits that comes with it. One of our founders came back from New Zealand and brought the skill of kombucha brewing with him that we have then honed to our special flavours and nuances. In the past two year we have grown from a small brewing unit in a sauna room to a fully equipped brewery. We are also selling kombucha starter kits and our own tea blends as an on-going effort to support growing kombucha community here in the nordics.

    <h3 class="sub-headline">Whatâ€˜s your current stage?</h3>
    <p>Most of our sales currently come nationally within Finland, but we have our eyes set for expansion in the Nordics. All our kombucha is produced in-house. As many of us brewers know, Kombucha is not a full-time job rather than a full on lifestyle :D
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-headline">What excites you most about Kombucha and its future?</h3>
    <p>
    Tea and tea based drinks along with fermented foodstuffs are a growing trend all over Europe and especially the nordics. People are looking for better and more natural options for sodas and energy drinks. We feel that Kombucha is only scratching the surface of emerging trend for healthy, living, organic, and locally produced beverages.

    Always great to meet fellow brewers and kombucha lovers to share experiences and inspiration. Also, knowing the latest developments in kombucha industry is very important, be it regulation or emerging trends. Looking forward to meeting you all in Berlin :)
