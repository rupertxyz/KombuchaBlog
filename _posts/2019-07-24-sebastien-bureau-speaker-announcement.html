  <p>We're very excited to announce Sébastien Bureau as our speaker at the Kombucha Summit in October! A technical expert in Kombucha brewing and fermentation,
  Sébastien will speak about the tips and tricks on how to sustainably scale Kombucha productions.
  <h3 class="sub-headline">About Sébastien</h3>
  <p>Founder and president of Mannanova, Sébastien is always busy concocting something or other. Since a young age, he has devoted many hours in the kitchen, experimenting with ingredients and exploring flavours & techniques. With a background in chemistry and biology, Seb has continually honed his passion for food science. He spent several years as VP of R&D for Rise Kombucha, the biggest kombucha company in Canada, and played a critical role in its growth phase. He’s the man with the plan, and hopes to extend his wealth of knowledge to producers of ecological & sustainable foods and beverages.
